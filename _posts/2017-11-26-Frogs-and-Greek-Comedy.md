## Frogs ##

As we discuss *Frogs* today, I'd like to consider the following question:**what is the role of comedy in the *polis*?**

To help us begin to tackle this, let's look at the parabasis of *Frogs*. According to ancient testimony, the Athenians voted that this play be reperformed because of the parabasis. In particular, let's look at the two speeches of the chorus leader:

What advice does the chorus leader give to the city? What does this tell us about the role or status of comedy in political life? What about *Lysistrata*?

**INSERT PASSAGE FROM LYSISTRATA**

Think more broadly of Greek comedy. Based on what you know, what function in society do you think it serve?

-Carnival: the release of social tensions.
-Political agenda
-Entertainment
-Religious function
