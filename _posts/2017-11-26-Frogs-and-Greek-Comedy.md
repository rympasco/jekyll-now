Today we'll be discussing Aristophanes' *Frogs*. 

But first, a few announcements:

- There will be a quiz next week, **Monday, December 4th**.

- Your final paper is due at our last class **Monday, December 11th**.

- Final exam review during the reading period (**Wednesday the 13th - Friday the 15th**).

## Staging the *Frogs* ##

We spent our last section asking the question: 'how would you adapt *[Antigone](https://rympasco.github.io/Antigone "Antigone")* for a modern audience?' In a similar vein, I'd like to kick off class watching a scene from a performance of *Frogs* performed at Cambridge University.

What challenges might you face adapting *Frogs* for a modern audience? How would you adapt the contest between Aeschylus and Euripides? 

Aeschylus is:

- Old-fashioned

- Martial themes

- Elevated Style

- Heroic characters

Euripides: 

- New-fangled

- Associated with rhetoric/'intellectual'

- Lower, more colloquial style

- Gives prominent speaking roles to women, slaves, etc.

**What similar poets/performers might you pick?**

Stephen Sondheim's 1974 adaptation replaces Aeschylus with Shakespeare and Euripides with George Bernard Shaw. 

## *Frogs* and Politics ##

In our discussion, I'd like to consider the following question: **what is the role of comedy in the *polis*?** According to ancient testimony, the Athenians voted that this play be reperformed due to the contents of the parabasis. Let's take a look then. In particular, let's look at the two speeches of the chorus leader:

![FrogsParabasis1](https://rympasco.github.io/images/FrogsParabasis1.png)

![FrogsParabasis2](https://rympasco.github.io/images/FrogsParabasis2.png)

- What advice does the chorus leader give to the city? 

- What does this tell us about the role or status of comedy in political life?

- Imagine you're a Greek citizen in the audience, watching this comedy. Would you take this political message seriously?

Think more broadly of Greek comedy. Imagine you're a budding Athenian intellectual and want to prove your literary talents. What can writing comedy offer you that other genres (tragedy, history, etc.) can't? If you're an Athenian, why go watch comedies?

-Carnival: the release of social tensions.

-Political agenda

-Entertainment

-Religious function

## Greek Comedy & Contemporary Society ##

Is there any modern equivalent to Greek comedy?

**Take a minute and try to think of some examples**.


Here are two comparisons that come to my mind:
### South Park

What aspects of comedy do these capture? What aspects do they not?
