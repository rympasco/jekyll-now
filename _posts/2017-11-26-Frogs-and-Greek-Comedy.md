## Frogs ##
As we discuss *Frogs* today, I'd like to consider the following question:**what is the role of comedy in the *polis*?**

To help us begin to tackle this, let's look at the parabasis of *Frogs*. According to ancient testimony, the Athenians voted that this play be reperformed because of the parabasis. In particular, let's look at the two speeches of the chorus leader:

What advice does the chorus leader give to the city?
