Today, we'll be discussing Sophocles' *Antigone*. Since you're familiar with the text, let's take a moment to visualize the play as *performance*, instead of as static texts. 

To begin, I thought we'd start by looking at a few other interpretations of the play. As we watch each version, consider what interpretive decisions the director/theatre company is making. What choices do they make regarding **staging, costume, and acting**? Are there any aspects of *Antigone* that you feel are **lost** in these performances? 

## Dialogue
First, we'll look at two different versions of dialogue between Antigone and Creon.

What difference do we see in the character of Antigone? The staging? The setting?

## Chorus 
Dialogue is easy enough, but how about the chorus? How might you approach staging the chorus as a modern playwright or film-maker?
