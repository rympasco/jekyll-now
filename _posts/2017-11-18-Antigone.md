Today, we'll be discussing Sophocles' *Antigone*. Since you're familiar with the text, let's take a moment to visualize the play as *performance*, instead of as static text. To begin, I thought we'd start by imagining how we might stage the play. 

To make it easier, let's look at a particular scene. Here, Creon confronts Antigone about her disobedience. Or, as one YouTube commentor calls it:

<p align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week in my Greek Civ section is Antigone! Overarching goal is to see the play as a performance and not just a text by asking: how would you stage/film an adaptation of Antigone? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teachancient?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#teachancient</a> <a href="https://t.co/KScylsCHsn">pic.twitter.com/KScylsCHsn</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Pasco (@rympasco) <a href="https://twitter.com/rympasco/status/932113997595279360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

Imagine you're a film-maker or director. Take a moment to imagine how you might stage the play. What would be the challenges in adapting Antigone for a contemporary audience? What setting would you choose? Costume? Acting? What parts of the play would be important to capture?

**Take out a sheet of paper and take notes on your thoughts**.

## Interpretations of Dialogue Scene

Thankfully, though, we're not the first people to try this. Let's look at two different versions this scene in two adaptations of *Antigone*. Our first is a 1986 BBC production starring Juliet Stevenson as Antigone and Patrick Barr as Creon:

Let's compare this with a more recent (2012) production by the National Theatre Company with Jodie Whittaker as Antigone and Christopher Eccleston as Creon.

How do these two interpretations differ in setting, tone, and character? Which do you feel reads better for a modern audience? Which do you find more faithful to the play you read? Which captures the feeling of *Antigone* more effectively? Why?

## Dealing with the Chorus
Dialogue, though, is easy-mode. How would you deal with adapting the chorus? Will it 'work' with a modern audience? Let's look at a particular scene:

Let's look at how the two adaptations above approach the chorus:

What approaches does each take? Which do you find more successful?
