Today, we'll be discussing Sophocles' *Antigone*. Since you're familiar with the text, let's take a moment to visualize the play as *performance*, instead of as static text. To begin, I thought we'd start by imagining how we might stage the play. Imagine you're a film-maker or director. Take a moment to imagine how you might stage the play. What setting would you choose? Costume? Acting? What parts of the play would be important to capture?

To make it easier, let's look at a particular scene. Here, Creon confronts Antigone about her disobedience. Or, as one YouTube commentor calls it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week in my Greek Civ section is Antigone! Overarching goal is to see the play as a performance and not just a text by asking: how would you stage/film an adaptation of Antigone? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teachancient?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#teachancient</a> <a href="https://t.co/KScylsCHsn">pic.twitter.com/KScylsCHsn</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Pasco (@rympasco) <a href="https://twitter.com/rympasco/status/932113997595279360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2017</a></blockquote>

Let's see two different interpretations:

### National Theatre Company's *Antigone*
First, we'll look at an argument between Antigone (Jodie Whittaker) and Creon (Christopher Eccleston)

What difference do we see in the character of Antigone? The staging? The setting? What do you think each performance got right? What do you think they got wrong?

## Chorus
Dialogue is easy mode: now what about the chorus?
